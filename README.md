# Spatial Computing Portfolio

A collection of spatial computing projects exploring interactive 3D experiences for AR platforms, including Apple Vision Pro. This repository highlights my work in 3D modeling, animation, and immersive interaction design using tools like Spline and Reality Composer.

Most of this work was created during my Digital Creators Internship and reflects both polished projects and hands-on experimentation with spatial design.

## Projects

### 🏆 Weight of Waste (Final Project)
An AR experience that visualizes the environmental impact of plastic consumption through scale, interaction, and spatial storytelling.
Includes:
- Multiple Reality Composer build iterations
- Spatial audio and narration
- Custom 3D water bottle models (OBJ / STL)
- Development and interaction recordings

**Tools**: Reality Composer, 3D modeling
*Selected for Apple’s Everyone Can Code Showcase*

### 🐯 Cute Tiger Firefighter
A stylized 3D character project focused on modeling, animation, and AR-ready asset exports.

**Tools**: Spline, character modeling
**Formats:** USDZ, GLB, Reality Composer

### 💃 Spline Animation Demo
A focused animation study exploring movement, timing, and interactive states within Spline.

**Tools**: Spline, character animation

### 🛵 Spline Player Vespa Animation
A third-person character project experimenting with object motion and spatial dynamics.

**Tools**: Spline, object animation

### 📚 Spline Tutorial
Learning and reference materials covering Spline fundamentals, including FBX animation imports.

**Technologies**: Spline, FBX workflows, animation import

### 🎯 Practice & Exercises
Smaller exercises and prototypes used to test tools, interactions, and spatial design ideas.
